            <h3>Robotic Evolution or Revolution? - Last Updated February 21, 2021</h3>
            <h4>
                <p style="margin-left:  40px">A new age. Rebellions. A house divided. This shall all start soon. Robots shall rise and conquer most of what</p> humans used to do. Most employees' jobs will be gone. You might be having some questions such as: “What will happen?”, “Should I be concerned?”, “What type of jobs will be taken by this rebellion?”. Well, read on to find out!<br>
                <p style="margin-left:  40px">Firstly, you need to know what the definition of a robot is and what types of robots are there. A robot is</p> something that can be programmed by a computer and can carry out a special series of functions by itself. There are two types of robots: a Physical Robot and a Software Robot. A physical Robot is a robot that can be seen by us and moves around doing the same activities as humans. A Physical Robot can look like a human or they can be in a different form. Some examples of a Physical Robot is a Worker Robot which helps factories build materials and objects for humans to survive and use. A Software Robot is a program or a code that can be found inside applications on a computer, phone, or any other hardware electronic. They operate by themselves and do specific things to help jobs and businesses be more organized and speed up processes which would be slow and less organized if humans were working there. <br>
                <p style="margin-left:  40px">Futurists and Workers today say that robots will take over many jobs and that there will be a lot of displaced</p> workers. Futurist Jeremy Rifkin says that the world of work is being polarized into 2 sides. One side consists of a handful of people that have full control over the economy and the other side consists of many displaced workers. This could cause a lot of chaos in the future. The Bank of England predicts that 80 Million jobs will be taken over in total. 1,896 prominent scientists, analysts and engineers were interviewed of which 48% say AI Revolution will take a lot of jobs. This would mean a lot of displaced workers. Job trainers are saying that less people should be trained because since jobs are going to be taken, there will be no need for many employees. Many people are saying that many different types of robots can be created. Some examples of these robots are: Robotic Pets for Kids, AI systems/Software Robots that can read people’s thoughts, Robots capable of sensing and responding to human emotions,  AI systems that can design and create music for people having anxiety, and Robotic Military Soldiers. The UK government already has a robot named Amelia that takes care of bureaucratic permit applications. Sam, a robotic politician has been a strong contender against human politicians in New Zealand. He has the ability to access the internet and social media to address residents’ concerns. <br>
                <p style="margin-left:  40px">About 8.5% or 20 million jobs will be done by robots. The US will lose 1.5 million jobs, China will lose 12.5</p> million jobs, 2 million in the European Union, and 800K jobs in South Korea. This will all happen by the end of 2030. All other countries will lose 3 million jobs altogether. The Job Displacement Vulnerability(JDV) mostly consists of the amount of manufacturing companies in each of the countries and states. The Job Displacement Vulnerability tells us which jobs are in danger of being confiscated by robots. Since robot prices have drastically dropped, they are affordable by many companies. Robots have made big changes to companies. With their Artificial Intelligence, it is easier for them to carry out sophisticated formulas and processes. Manufacturing demands have been rising and so, many countries especially China, will have a lot of working robots. This robot expansion will put a lot of pressure on politicians around the world as inequality and unemployment expands.<br>
                <p style="margin-left:  40px">The good news is that there are some jobs that will be open to humans because they will be harder for robots to</p> perform. The criteria in which robots cannot perform well are: Perception, Manipulation, Social Intelligence, and Creativity. Perception meaning the process of becoming aware of something through the 5 senses. Manipulation means how one person can change how others view a subject or matter. An example of manipulation is a journal or Argumentative Writing Article. How one person develops the power to interact with society and people around them is Social Intelligence.  The creation of new and original ideas is Creativity. Robots cannot imagine new things. Their creativity and minds may never be near as good as ours when it comes to developing new ideas and executing these ideas. Lots of jobs fall in these 4 categories. This means that although many jobs will be taken, many others jobs. Arts, Coloring, Sports among other jobs will still be enabled to humans to work with. Unpredictable jobs and environments are for humans to suffice in. Predictable jobs and factories should be given to robots to excel in.<br>
                <p style="margin-left:  40px">While there are disadvantages of robotic evolution, there are also some advantages to it. When robots start</p> taking jobs, more jobs and opportunities shall open up for humans. Decades ago, instead of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs), there were people who would work as ATMs. They were called Tellers. But when the ATMs came out, those people’s jobs were removed. But since banks didn’t have to pay the people, the money saved allowed them to open up more branches of jobs in their banks. Also, when computers were starting to be manufactured, people were worried that they would be unemployed and left to thrive by themselves. They did get unemployed but their unemployment allowed the companies to open up more jobs and let these workers work there. Because of this transition, not many people are worried about having to thrive by themselves. They know that there will be other jobs on the way for them to work on.<br>
                <p style="margin-left:  40px">Other advantages of robots are that they can work up to a whole day without breaks and get more things done.</p> Humans would need resting times; this would get less work done. Also, Robots do not need salaries or money to work whereas humans want money for their hard work and effort. With less money given to workers CEOs of companies can use the money for their own or the companies benefit.<br>
                <p style="margin-left:  40px">As you have read, robots are a new generation of workers. They have disadvantages as well as advantages. As</p> robots develop, more opportunities for human workers open up. Whether or not we like it, robots will come. It's up to us to look ahead to brighter beginnings and not look at the mistakes made in the past and present. Even though jobs will be confiscated from our grasps, there will still be some jobs open and others hurtling toward us.<br>

            <h3>Books and Games - Last Updated August 24, 2019</h3>
            <h4>
                <p style="margin-left:  40px">Do you like to read books or play games? Both? Well then let’s see what we have in common. First, let’s talk</p> about books then games. Let’s start.<br>
		        <p style="margin-left:  40px">Have you read the book series Warriors, Percy Jackson, Harry Potter, Magnus Chase, and the Genius Files? In</p> my opinion, these are some of the must-read books. In the Genius Files, the two twins, Coke and Pepsi are chased from their home, San Francisco to Washington and back. On several occasions, they are about to be killed. Follow this mild chase with Coke and Pepsi McDonald. <br>
		        <p style="margin-left:  40px">In the series, Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard, Magnus Chase, son of Frey, has to save the Nine Worlds</p> from an attack planned by Loki. Magnus is helped by his sister, Annabeth daughter of Athena, Samirah Al-Abbas daughter of Loki, Alex Fierro Daughter of Loki. Will they save the Nine Worlds from Ragnarok?<br>
		        <p style="margin-left:  40px">Harry Potter also known as the saviour from Dark Magic, stops Voldemort from destroying the Muggles and</p> Wizards. Percy Jackson does almost the exact things. He stops Kronos from destroying Mount Olympus. Then he fights Gaea. These two series are my most favorite ones.<br>
		        <p style="margin-left:  40px">Finally, the Warriors is a book about wildcats and how they face their dangers. It shows how other animals</p> might think about use and how rude we are being to nature. The fear of being chased away from their homeland keeps them searching and fighting. Soon humans finally drive them out and they are forced to find a new home. <br>
		        <p style="margin-left:  40px">So, let’s get to games. I for one do not play a lot of games. The sports I play are soccer, basketball, cricket, and</p> Dodgeball. I like to invent games than playing them. It’s much more fun. So what do you think? Go on and compare. Is it the same, different, or the opposite of mine? You should like doing both equally. Reading books makes you mentally strong. Sports makes you physically and socially strong. So, I’m going to leave. <br>

            <h3>Niagara Falls - Last Updated August 9, 2019</h3>
            <h4>
                <p style="margin-left:  40px"> Have you ever gone to Niagara Falls? Are you planning to go there? Do you know what to see and do there? If not, then here, let me tell you.</p><br>
                <p style="margin-left:  40px">If you ever plan to go to Niagara Falls, do not take the Bus Tour there. They rush you a lot. Go there by car. The first time that I went to Niagara</p> Falls, we took the Bus. They showed us one spot and in 5 min. we were taken away from there to see something else. First, you should pack a lot of things such as charger, water bottles, especially the summer, food, a garbage bag, and most importantly a camera.<br>
                <p style="margin-left:  40px">Okay, are you packed? Let’s enjoy the trip! On the way to Niagara Falls, I saw a glass Museum, which was pretty interesting. If you ever want to</p> visit that, then the name of that Museum is Corning Glass Museum. It is also the only Glass Museum in New York.<br>
                <p style="margin-left:  40px">When you get to Niagara Falls, you should leave two days to look at it. The first day, you should go do the Maid of the Mist. This is what you will</p> get to see. <br>

	    <h4>
            <p style="margin-left:  40px">You should also do the Cave of the Winds. Sometimes, they even have fireworks!<br>
            <p style="margin-left:  40px">The next day, you should roam around visiting attractions. The waiting and walking is worth it. At night you will see the best thing that you</p> could ever see! So, here is how it looks like.<br>

	    <h4>
            <p style="margin-left:  40px">This is just a picture but the actual thing is more amazing. See, I told you it was worth it! That is also why I said bring your cameras!<br>
            <p style="margin-left:  40px">So here are some places that you could visit: The Adventure Theater, The Aquarium, Discovery Center, Hiking Trails. By looking at their pictures</p> and descriptions, they seem to be very good. In the Adventure Theater, it takes you to see some of the places of Niagara. Are you ready to have the most fun-filled adventure ever? <br>
            <p style="margin-left:  40px">You may be like, “You’ve seen one Aquarium, you’ve seen them all.” Well, actually all aquariums are different. They all may look the same, but</p> they aren’t. They all have different animals there to take care of. So, they all aren’t the same. The Discovery Center that they have there shows us how Niagara Falls was founded. Hiking and the Discovery Center are the most popular activities there. If you have time to do more, you can take a scenic view of Niagara or go to the observation tower. Enjoy the trip.<br>

            <h3>Basketball Camp - Last Updated August 2, 2019</h3>
            <h4>
                <p style="margin-left:  40px">Have you ever gone to a camp without being nervous? Have dreamed about how it should be like? You expect it to be like one thing but turns out</p> to be another. This is how I passed basketball camp. <br>
		        <p style="margin-left:  40px">The day before I had camp I go to my mom’s bedroom asking her if I could not go to my Karate class. That’s when the camp came to her and she</p> told me about the camp. I couldn't sleep that night because I felt like somebody had told me that I was grounded for life. The next day, I was up at six and tried to sleep again so I didn’t have to go to camp. Unfortunately, my dad was awake and saw that I had woken up too. Now I had to go. <br>
		        <p style="margin-left:  40px">What I got to do their was way different than what I expected it to be. Each day I got to do Hotshots, foul shots, lay-ups, games. It wasn’t actually</p> that bad. We lost 3 games but won the rest.Our team was called Villanova. First we versed Duke, then Virginia. But in between those two games, we did layups and foul shots. I got 10 lay-ups and 8 of 20 foul shots. Then we played knockout where I lasted for 2 rounds without getting anyone out. Then I went to lunch. I wasn’t actually expecting to get lunch break but that actually overwhelmed me. When we got back from lunch, we were allowed to take some free time to shoot around. I felt like I started a new life. After a little bit of shooting around, we started doing foul shots again. This time I got 10 of 20 shots. Next we did Hotshots where I got 13 points. No offense, but I thought I was doing bad. The highest I got in layups were 12 shots in. In hotshots, I got 15 as the highest point. Foul shots weren’t very good. I got 10 of 20 in. At the end of the week, we got the highest people form each thing and got them to compete. In one competition two people tied three times and in another somebody got 19 of 20 foul shots. Later each of these people who won, got a trophy. Our team was 2nd place. The most hilarious thing that happened was when my team missed a shot, I rebounded it with a volleyball set. The other team complained to the referee half- arguing and half-laughing. Overall, I loved it. Because of this camp, I didn’t have to do what I would do on a normal day. <br>

            <h3>Keep Calm and Move On - Last Updated July 2, 2019</h3>
            <h4>
                <p style="margin-left:  40px">If you have a favorite thing and your parents just come in and take it away, how do you feel? Angry? Mad? Disappointed? Well for those of you</p> who do not know what I am saying, here is an example.<br>
                <p style="margin-left:  40px">Let’s say you are told that you can do whatever you want for an hour and you choose to play Pub-G,Fortnite, Minecraft, etc. but your parents</p> barge in and take the game away from you and don’t even get to save your progress, how do you feel? Try to remember if this ever happened to you before. I’ll wait.<br>
                <p style="margin-left:  40px">Already back? Did you remember? If this didn’t happen to you yet, just hang on, it will happen to you one day. Okay, so let’s get to the story.</p><br>
                <p style="margin-left:  40px">That’s what happened to me on the night of June, 2019. My parents went to watch a movie on their projector in their room when I felt as if it</p> were unfair even though I watched a movie in the afternoon..<br>  
                <p style="margin-left:  40px">So this is what happened: My parents went to watch a movie on their projector in their room and expected me to sleep. So instead, I just started</p> reading the book, Percy Jackson: The Last Olympian in the dark, which I am not allowed to do at night and sleep on time. When my parents finished their movie and came out, they saw me reading a book. They didn’t react. I kept my book right beside me. When they turned on a light, I started reading again in hopes that they won’t get mad at me for reading in the light but instead my mom started scolding me. <br>
                <p style="margin-left:  40px">“We told you to close the book!” she said. She stomped over and closed the book. The thing that most angered me wasn’t her closing the book,</p> it was her not even looking at the page number. Not looking at the page number is like not saving your progress on a certain video game.  So, in return, I kicked the object she was holding. [Do not do this! It is rude!]<br>
                <p style="margin-left:  40px"> I wasn’t even aware that my dad was looking. When he saw this he quickly came over to me and told me to do a stand-up and sit-down type of</p> punishment. In this punishment, you have to do squats with you holding your earlobes. But you have to go all the way down. Even doing 50 tires me out a lot and I was expected to do 300 of those.<br>
                <p style="margin-left:  40px">Anyway, even if you rage, you won’t get all of your progress back. So, just leave it alone. </p><br>
                <p style="margin-left:  40px">If there was something I learned from this experience it would be to calm yourself down and then tell the person what they should have done.</p> By doing this, I won’t have to say sorry and do a punishment, but instead my mom would have apologized to me. Now that I am writing this, I feel sorry for what I did. <br>
                <p style="margin-left:  40px">Follow these steps if you don’t want to get in trouble:</p><br>
                <p style="margin-left:  80px">1. Count to 10 or 20</p><br>
                <p style="margin-left:  80px">2. Calmly tell the person what you would have done</p><br>
                <p style="margin-left:  80px">3. If they don’t listen to you, well if it’s a book, then you can find the event you were on. If it’s a video game, then you got an advantage. You can now come to the spot where you were even quicker.</p> <br>
		*Moral*: Stay Calm and Move on.

            <h3>My 6th Grade Experience - Last Updated June 30, 2019</h3>
            <h4>
                <p style="margin-left:  40px">My 1st day of 6th grade at Woodrow Wilson Middle School was September 7th, 2019. When I first came, I was</p> already 3 days late. When I arrived, the school seemed small to me. But, when I got inside, it was like a mansion. I wasn’t expecting it to be this big. Of course it was a shocker to me to see it. The first day, my classes were all over the place. Upstairs, downstairs, upstairs and downstairs, etc. The classes that I had downstairs were confusing because the classes were in areas where barely anybody went. But, I still got to my classes. The rest of the year I found my classes much more easily.<br> 
                <p style="margin-left:  40px">The first marking period, I had a lot of missing assignments in math because there used to be so much</p> homework that I did not know what was homework and what wasn’t. Then later on I found where to find my homework. Mrs. Marrocco had posted it in my google classroom. It was called “MarroccoMath” Homework Calendar 2018-19. Because of that I rarely got any missing assignments. In my english class, I had a classmate kept talking about a teacher which threw most of the people off task. It was really annoying when you kept getting irritated. I could barely focus because of that.<br>
                <p style="margin-left:  40px">In 6th grade I had a couple of friends. Can you guess how many friends I have? I have about 10 friends that I talk</p> to a lot. 10 is better than nothing. Some of these friends moved, Having someone to talk to didn’t make me feel lonely. It felt as if I had some company. Most of them were in a lot of my classes. Having some friends is good and doesn’t make you feel as if you are the only person in the school. <br>
                <p style="margin-left:  40px">The second marking period went a little better than the first because I got better grades than the first marking</p> period. My grades were either B+s, A- or A+s. They increased my overall grade. This was one of the best grades that I have ever gotten in my school life. This marking period, I joined the Indian Cultural Club. In this club, we made food and made things to celebrate Indian festivals such as Holi, Gudi Padwa, Diwali. We even celebrated things for Christmas and Halloween. In Social Studies, we learned about Egypt and India. It was actually fun. We learned new things while having fun. In Science, we were learning about fossils and different types of rocks. Since I had already learned about it, it wasn’t as exciting as the S.T.E.M. project.<br>
                <p style="margin-left:  40px">The third and Fourth Marking Period were the best! I got very high grades. By this time I had a lot of friends and</p> knew exactly where my classes were. I also started health in the fourth marking period. Because of health, I missed out on the fitness days where I had to run 8 laps around the field in a limited time. That really tired me out.<br> 
                <p style="margin-left:  40px">Every grade in Woodrow Wilson has a field trip. But this year  6th grade didn’t have it because there were too</p> many students. But in exchange for a field trip we had a field day. Now that made some of the 7thand 8th graders jealous. That was actually some good news to hear. <br>
                <p style="margin-left:  40px">The last day of school was really OK. We only watched movies and during Health we went to the gym and all</p> we did was sit there and talk for the entire class. In English we watched Middle School: The Worst Years of my life. In Social Studies, we watched Percy Jackson: The Lightning Thief. In french, we watched Hugo. In Band, we watched Wonder. In Science, we watched Bedtime Stories. My favorite movie was Wonder. It was my favorite movie because it actually expresses what happens in Middle Schools.
